This repository contains a demonstration of a dataâ€‘driven betting pipeline.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to experiment with the demo. You can
adjust system parameters or load sample matches from `matches.json`. If you
run a local scraping service at `localhost:3001`, the "Fetch Web Matches"
button will retrieve live data, analyse it and display the results using the
same pipeline.

## Framework Highlights (May 2025)

- Singles require EV of at least **+10%**, while system legs need **+2%**.
- Bankroll allocation defaults to **40% singles** and **60% systems**.
- Staking uses half-Kelly sizing capped at **5%** of bankroll per bet.
