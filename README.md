This repository contains a demonstration of a dataâ€‘driven betting pipeline.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to experiment with the demo. You can
adjust system parameters or load sample matches from `matches.json`. If you
run a local scraping service at `localhost:3001` you can also fetch current
matches directly from the web via the "Fetch Web Matches" button.
