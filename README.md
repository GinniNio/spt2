This repository contains a demonstration of a dataâ€‘driven betting pipeline.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to experiment with the demo. Use the
file picker above the **Load Matches** button to select a JSON file containing
match data. After selecting your file, click **Load Matches** to analyse those
games. If you run a local scraping service at `localhost:3001`, the "Fetch Web
Matches" button will retrieve live data and display the results using the same
pipeline.

### Analysis Modes

The drop-down menu lets you choose **Conservative**, **Balanced**, or **Aggressive** analysis. These modes adjust EV thresholds and confidence levels to match your risk appetite.

## Framework Highlights (May 2025)

- Singles require EV of at least **+10%**, while system legs need **+2%**.
- Bankroll allocation defaults to **40% singles** and **60% systems**.
- Staking uses half-Kelly sizing capped at **5%** of bankroll per bet.
